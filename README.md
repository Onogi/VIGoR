# VIGoR
VIGoR (Variational Bayesian Inference for Genome-Wide Regression) conducts linear regression using variational Bayesian inference, particularly optimized for genome-wide association mapping and whole-genome prediction which use a number of SNPs as the explanatory variables. VIGoR provides seven regression models (Bayesian lasso, extended Bayesian lasso, BayesA, BayesB, BayesC, Bayesian ridge regression, and BLUP). This directory contains the R packages, pdf documents, and archives. From ver.1.1.0, VIGoR enables to incorporate multiple regression methods (e.g., BayesC and Bayesian lasso) with different explanatory variables simultaneously in a single model.

The latest version is 1.1.3. Previous versions are also available from Archive.
